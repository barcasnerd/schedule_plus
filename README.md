## Simple NODE Js Template
 This is a template to create a simple but effective Node Js project.

 ## Instalation
 Clone the code into your PC, then use the following command to install the dependencies by using the console commands.

 ```npm i ```
> **Note:** Acces first to the project cloned folder using the command ```cd```.
 ## Organization
 * ### **node_modules:** Do not edit this folder, it contains the "dependencies" of project.
 * ### **src folder**: Contains editable information and code.
     *  **public:**  Use this folder to store public files.
     >  Like images or video.
     * **routes:**  You can use this folder to manage the acces routes in your application.
     > The main route is always mark as /
     * **views:** Use this folder to manage the final views for the browser.
     > html, javascript or css content
    * **index.js:** This file manages the server of the project.
    * **.gitignore:** Manages the node dependencies to low the size of the git repository.
    > Generally node_modules folder is listed
    * **package.json:** Describe the project and list the dependencies. 
    > You can also edit this file to set the project's description or author.
    * **package-lock.json:** Complementary to "package.json"
    
    > Use the following command to run the project:
    
    ```npm run dev ```
    
    And that's all, now you can use it in your own project. Do not forget to give a star this repo.
